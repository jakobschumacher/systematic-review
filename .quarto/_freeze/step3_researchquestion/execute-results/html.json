Matching questions with appropriate study design and review type is a key step in conducting research Well-formulated research questions will guide many aspects of conducting reviews PICO(S) scheme helps defining a specific research question for systematic reviews\n\n\n\n## How to find a research question\n\n1. Find your topic\n1. Conduct a preliminary literature search\n1. Write a draft of your question\n1. Check for PICO and FINER (or other schemes)\n1. Check with another literature search \n1. Check in registries  \n1. Check with stakeholder/colleagues\n\n## Tools to help formulate a research question\n\n-   [PICO](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/about-pico)\n-   PEO\n-   SPIDER\n-   PCC\n\n### PICOS\nIts a commonly used tool  \n- Patient/population/problem \n- Intervention \n- comparison \n- Outcome\n- Setting\n\n\n### Scheme: FINER\nFeasible Interesting Novel Ethical Relevant\n\n### Scheme: MAPS\nManagable Appropriate Potential value and publishability Systematic\n\n\n## Types of research question\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n|Question |Type|\n|---|---|\n|What proportion of the population is newly diagnosed with this disease each year?|Incidence|\n|What proportion of the population is currently living with this disease? |Prevalence|\n|What can be done to treat this disease? |Therapy|\n|Will early detection of this disease make a difference in a personâ€˜s life? |Screening|\n|How good is this test at detecting the disease?| Diagnostic accuracy|\n|What is the likely outcome of this disease? |Prognosis|\n|Can there be any negative effects (of an intervention)? |Harm|\n|How can this disease be prevented? |Etiology|\n:::\n\n\n\n## Characteristics of good research question\n\nThe most successful research questions are narrowly focused and carefully defined but are important parts of a broad-ranging, complex problem.\n\nA good research question is beneficial as it \n\n* details the problem statement \n* further describes and refines the issue under study \n* adds focus to the problem statement \n* guides data collection and analysis \n* sets context of research\n\n## Example\n\n_In ZIKV-free infants or children, does breastfeeding (any or exclusive) from a ZIKV-infected lactating mother, compared to not breastfeeding, result in evidence of ZIKV infection in the infant?_\n\n## Check with stakeholders and colleagues\n\nBest practice is to engage stakeholder including users in setting the question possibly through an advisory group \n\n- Does the review question sound interesting and useful \n- What interventions should be included \n- Which population should be included \n- Are there subgroups \n- What types of outcomes should the review include?\n\n\n## Document \nYour research question should be documented in your protocol. The research question should also be used for the title.\n",
