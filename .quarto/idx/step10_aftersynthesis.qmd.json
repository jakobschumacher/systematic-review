reviews\n- Its unethical to produce rubbish\n\n### Four ethical considerations in medicine\n- Autonomy - you respect the wish of the patients\n- Justice - everybody has the same rights\n- Benevolence - you are actively trying to do good\n- Non-maleficiance - you are trying not to do bad things\n\n\n## Dissemination\nPlan you dissemination upfront\n\n### Possible ways to disseminate\n- Journal\n- Conferences\n- Policy dialogues\n- Press release\n- Social media\n\n### Policy brief \n- Many journals now want a policy brief\n- Big organisations now publish directly policy briefs\n\n### Graphs\n-
