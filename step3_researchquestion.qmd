title: "Step 3: Formulate your research question"
---

> The identification of the best evidence requires the construction of an appropriate research question and review of the literature. Matching questions with appropriate study design and review type is a key step in conducting research Well-formulated research questions will guide many aspects of conducting reviews PICO(S) scheme helps defining a specific research question for systematic reviews



## How to find a research question

1. Find your topic
1. Conduct a preliminary literature search
1. Write a draft of your question
1. Check for PICO and FINER (or other schemes)
1. Check with another literature search 
1. Check in registries  
1. Check with stakeholder/colleagues

## Tools to help formulate a research question

-   [PICO](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/about-pico)
-   PEO
-   SPIDER
-   PCC

### PICOS
Its a commonly used tool  
- Patient/population/problem 
- Intervention 
- comparison 
- Outcome
- Setting


### Scheme: FINER
Feasible Interesting Novel Ethical Relevant

### Scheme: MAPS
Managable Appropriate Potential value and publishability Systematic


## Types of research question
```{r,  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
|Question |Type|
|---|---|
|What proportion of the population is newly diagnosed with this disease each year?|Incidence|
|What proportion of the population is currently living with this disease? |Prevalence|
|What can be done to treat this disease? |Therapy|
|Will early detection of this disease make a difference in a personâ€˜s life? |Screening|
|How good is this test at detecting the disease?| Diagnostic accuracy|
|What is the likely outcome of this disease? |Prognosis|
|Can there be any negative effects (of an intervention)? |Harm|
|How can this disease be prevented? |Etiology|

## Characteristics of good research question

The most successful research questions are narrowly focused and carefully defined but are important parts of a broad-ranging, complex problem.

A good research question is beneficial as it 

* details the problem statement 
* further describes and refines the issue under study 
* adds focus to the problem statement 
* guides data collection and analysis 
* sets context of research

## Example

_In ZIKV-free infants or children, does breastfeeding (any or exclusive) from a ZIKV-infected lactating mother, compared to not breastfeeding, result in evidence of ZIKV infection in the infant?_

## Check with stakeholders and colleagues

Best practice is to engage stakeholder including users in setting the question possibly through an advisory group 

- Does the review question sound interesting and useful 
- What interventions should be included 
- Which population should be included 
- Are there subgroups 
- What types of outcomes should the review include?


## Document 
Your research question should be documented in your protocol. The research question should also be used for the title.
