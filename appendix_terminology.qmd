## Public health
_Public Health is the science and practice of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through organised efforts of society_
Central elements are 
  - the dual character of Public Health as science and practice 
  - integration an simulatneity of the five pillars of public health

Five pillars of Public Health
  - Health promotion
  - Prevention
  - Treatment
  - Rehabilitation
  - Long-term care
  
## Planetary Health
_Planetary health describes how human health depends on the health of ecosystems. The consequences of global climate change, species extinction, threats to oceans and air pollution call for a rethink of the health sector_
- Key concepts are 
  - Adaption 
  - Mitigation 
  
## Health policy
_Health pilicy id defined as the decisions, plans and actions that are undertaken to achive specific healthcare goals within a society_


## Epidemiology
_Epidemiology studies how diseases spread amongst human and non-human populations, of often disease occur in different groups of people and why_

## Evidence
_Findings from research and other knowledge that may serve as a basis for decision-making in Public health and healthcare_
What counts as evidence is context-dependent and is often broader that the knowledge produced through the scientific method.


## Evidence synthesis
_Is a type of research method that allows researchers to bringt together all relevant information on a research question_

## Bradford-Hill criteria

## Measures of effect and association
Relationships between exposures and outcomes are measured by measures of effect, which are statistics that estimate the direction and magnitude of associations among variables

### Disease occurrence/frequency

#### Prevalence
_Occurence of existing cases_
It is important that you have a representative sample otherwise you just have a proportion. 


$$ \text{Prevalence} = {\text{number of existing cases} \over \text{number of people in a population at a definded persiod of time}} $$

#### Incidence
_Occurence of new cases_

#### Incidence risk
_The incidence when the nominator is the same as the denominator_

$$ \text{Incidence risk} = {\text{number of new cases over a period of time} \over \text{number of people at risk at the beginning of the time period}} $$


#### Incidence rate
_The incidence whent the denominator is a time_
$$ \text{Incidence rate} = {\text{number of new cases over a period of time} \over \text{number of people at risk during the time period}} $$

#### Risk
_likelihood, thatt an event of interest will occur in a subject in a spedivied period of follow-up time_
The risk is a probability
The risk must be between 0 and 1
The denominator ist the population at the beginng


#### Rates
_Measures of the speed of something occuring of developing disease/events occurring in a population_
A rate ist not a probability
The rate is always non negative with no upper limit



#### Mortality
Mortality is a special measure of incidence rate
The mortality is a rate and thus has time in the denominator (usually expressed as person years)


$$ \text{Mortality} = {\text{number of deaths} \over \text{number of people per unit of time}} $$


### Measures of effect
- There are ratio measures (e.g., Odds Ratio, Risk Ratio, Rate Ratio) and difference measures (e.g., Risk difference, Attributable Risk, â€¦)
- Ratio measures are used in etiologic studies of health outcomes
- Difference measures are used to quantify population impact & public health importance of risk or protective factors that determine health outcomes (size of problem)

#### Odds ratio
$$ \text{Odds ratio} = {\text{probability of event} \over 1- \text{probability of event}} $$



#### Risk ratio
$$ \text{Relative risk} = {\text{Incidence in exposed} \over \text{Incidence in the not-exposed}} $$


### Rate ratio
_ratio of two average rates_



## Internal validity
_Internal validity relates to risk of bias within a study_
- See [Internal and external validity: can you apply research study results to your patients?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6188693/)

## External validity 
_The extent to which the conclusions of an empicircal investigation remain true when different research methods and research paricipants or subjects are used._
- External validity addresses generalizability or applicability of study results
- Whether our sample is generalizable to the general population.
