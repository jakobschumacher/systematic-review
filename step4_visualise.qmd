> A visualisation is helpful for clarifing your thoughts and to communicate the problem

## Logical models
_A logic model creates a diagrammatic representation of the key components of a programme and the way that actions are intended to lead to outcomes_ [The Better Care Fund (2015)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bcf-user-guide-04.pdf.pdf)
-  Use a logic models for the definition of research question. It is a conceptual diagram. The diagram helps to illustrate your view on the problem. It should help understand the big picture
- Use the logic models for communication, for example to politics
- Logical models are created by asking many if-then questions. 
- You can use a logical model throughout all stages of a review


### Steps in creation
This guide follows a [Tutorial by Ruth Knight](https://ruthknightphd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-v2-Logic-Model-E-BOOK-Updated-27_08_19-.pdf
)

### a. Participation
- Define who you want to participate
- Create a table for participation

|Who will be consulted|How we will consult with them|How will this be achieved|What we are consulting with them about|Who is responsible for collating feedback|
|---|---|---|---|---|

### b. State the problem
- Write down the problem concisely (preferably under 250 words)
- Address the following parts: Who is affected? What are the causes? What are the symptoms? Key findings of previous studies? What are the consequences?
- You can use the "Problem Tree Approach"

### c. State the solution
- Write down the goal or the intervention 
- It should contain a solution about the problem, that you stated earlier

### d. State the resources needed 
- This step is typical in the creation of a logical model but is probably not necessary for a systematic review, because we wont actually be doing a program 
- Write down what resources are needed to implement the solution for the problem (not the resources needed for doing a review)

### e. State the outputs
- What will happen if the solution is applied to the problem
- Outputs are the direct results of the intervention
- Outputs can be grouped
- You can divide the outputs in activities and who is affected

### f. State the outcomes
- Outcomes can be divided into short-term, medium-term and long-term outcomes

## Directed acylcic graphs (DAG)
- Use a DAG

You can put your logic model into the protocol
